    <p>When I coach agency owners, the conversations in our first sessions often revolve around positioning. I start by asking three questions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>What does your agency do better than any other agency in the world?</li>
      <li>If all your bills were paid for in perpetuity, what kind of work would your agency be Doing?</li>
      <li>What work are your clients asking you for?</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The more closely aligned the answer to those questions, the better your positioning is.
The “T-shaped” concept by McKinsey & Company is a great one for freelancers, but it certainly applies to agencies just as much. Possess the breadth of skills that make you and your team versatile enough to tackle anything, but advertise the depth of knowledge that makes you the perfect choice to solve your clients’ problems.</p>
